## Teaching Philosophy
As a feminist and anti-racist educator, I aim to help students develop critical thinking skills around gender and related social identities (including race, sexuality, class, ability, and nationality), interrogate systems of power and oppression, and develop the theoretical and methodological tools to build a more just world.
