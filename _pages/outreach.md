## Workshops

My workshops aim to teach participants how to create effective, beautiful qualitative data visualizations.

### 2019-2020. ESRI Story Map Workshops. _Suzzallo and Allen Libraries at University of Washington_. Seattle, WA.

This is a workshop I developed in my capacity as a GIS Staff Assistant with the University of Washington Libraries on ESRI's Class Story Map platform. You can find the materials for this workshop in this public [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hNwNKsgpyiIP4euY7a1XA3AlaFRnyRkM?usp=share_link). I strongly recommend starting with the [workshop guidelines](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1POqECvJPH96FCb7m2D5Vrkb17eIh4Zhg/view?usp=share_link).

### 2018. Workshop: Using Digital Humanities for Queer History. _University of Georgia LGBT Resource Center: Connect Conference._ Athens, GA.

I created this workshop in order to guide conference participants in using [TimelineJS](https://timeline.knightlab.com/), an open-source platform created by Knight Lab at Northwestern University for creating timelines using Google Spreadsheets. You can find the slideshow that I used [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hytupxbB8N1uu5zqKR04VsQHHHbgq3kLuJ4BC5_PERk/edit?usp=share_link).
