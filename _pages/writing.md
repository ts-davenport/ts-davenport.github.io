## Publications
### 2023 (under review). Davenport, Theodore. "Uncomfortable Trans Care Politics: Normativity, Institutional Abandonment, and the Obligation to Care"
This paper draws from work across care geographies and trans studies to challenge cisgender assumptions in care ethics and complicate the romanticization of care as a one-size-fits-all solution to trans injustice. I draw from 25 oral history interview transcripts from the New York City Trans Oral History Project and used a framework of uncomfortable care ethics to highlight how trans care practices are enmeshed with politics of gender normativity, trans survival, formal care abandonment, and compassion fatigue.

### 2020. Davenport, Theodore. “Becoming Theodore: Spatial Legal Consciousness and Transgender Name Changes” in E. Wood, ed. _Gender Justice and the Law: Theoretical Practices of Intersectional Identity._ Lanham, MD: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press.
Legal name changes are a powerful way that transgender people render their gender transition visible to the state. Some prominent work within trans socio-legal studies exists on how the legal administrations that center binary sex uniquely affect transgender people and shape legal consciousness around identity documents with gender markers. However, little work has explored how transgender people experience legal name changes, which are a much more common and accessible legal signifier of gender transition than changing gender markers nearly everywhere in the US. <b>Drawing from socio-legal studies and feminist geographies, this paper utilizes autoethnography to ask, how do transgender people experience legal name changes in everyday spaces?</b>
