I'm a Ph.D. student in [Geography](http://geography.washington.edu/) at University of Washington. I research queer/trans geographies, care, feminist methodologies, and digital geographies. This work is supervised by [Dr. Larry Knopp](http://directory.tacoma.uw.edu/employee/knoppl) and funded in part by the [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program](http://www.nsfgrfp.org/).

My Master's in Geography was also completed at University of Washington under the supervision of Dr. Knopp. My MA thesis explored how trans people in the United States enact and experience intra-community care practices through space. This work drew from interviews from [New York City Trans Oral History Project](https://www.nyctransoralhistory.org/), described as "a community archive devoted to the collection, preservation and sharing of trans histories, organized in collaboration with the New York Public Library."
