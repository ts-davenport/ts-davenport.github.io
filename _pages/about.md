I'm Teddy Davenport, a digital feminist geographer whose work focuses on the material conditions, community politics, and place-making practices of queer and trans people in the Anglosphere. I am a mixed-methods scholar with expertise in qualitative methods and Geographic Information Science (GIS).

I just defended my Ph.D. dissertation in [Geography](http://geography.washington.edu/) at University of Washington. Drawing from interviews and archival data, my [dissertation project](https://sites.google.com/view/transdigitalstudy/about-the-dissertation) evaluates how trans people have enacted care practices in digital spaces throughout the history of the Internet and how such digital care practices might inform movements for trans justice. This work was supervised by [Dr. Larry Knopp](http://directory.tacoma.uw.edu/employee/knoppl) and funded by the [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program](http://www.nsfgrfp.org/). I'm proud to be a Junior Fellow with the [Center for Applied Transgender Research](https://www.appliedtransstudies.org/about).

My Master's in Geography was also completed at University of Washington under the supervision of Dr. Knopp. This thesis explored how trans people in the United States enact and experience intra-community care practices, drawing from publicly-available interviews from [New York City Trans Oral History Project](https://www.nyctransoralhistory.org/).
