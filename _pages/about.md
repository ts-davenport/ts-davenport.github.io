I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in [Geography](http://geography.washington.edu/) at University of Washington. Drawing from interviews and archival data, my dissertation project evaluates how trans people have enacted care practices in digital spaces throughout the history of the Internet and how such digital care practices might provide potential to build critical trans politics. This work is supervised by [Dr. Larry Knopp](http://directory.tacoma.uw.edu/employee/knoppl) and funded in part by the [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program](http://www.nsfgrfp.org/). I'm proud to be a Junior Fellow with the [Center for Applied Transgender Research](https://www.appliedtransstudies.org/about).

My Master's in Geography was also completed at University of Washington under the supervision of Dr. Knopp. My MA thesis explored how trans people in the United States enact and experience intra-community care practices through space. This work drew from interviews from [New York City Trans Oral History Project](https://www.nyctransoralhistory.org/), described as "a community archive devoted to the collection, preservation and sharing of trans histories, organized in collaboration with the New York Public Library."
